Find nearest-matching string from a set

Computes shortest distance between a key string and a set of strings to
find the nearest match.

Uses a modified Vagner-Fischer algorithm to find the Levenshtein distance
between each pair of strings.  Progressively narrows the threshold to equal
the distance of the best match found so far, reducing run time.

Optional behaviors include an upper-bound threshold distance, detect first
or multiple matches of equal distance, case insensitivity.

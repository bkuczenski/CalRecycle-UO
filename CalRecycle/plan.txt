Need to put this to bed.  

Observable changes:

 * C / G / Tx / P categorization needs to be refined
 * origin facilities for out-of-state shipments need to be inspected
 * disposition needs to be improved
 * AVH is doing CR / facility-provided data checking
 * RFO overflow to DK to fill its consumption
 * need a "not used oil" disposition route
 * facility-specific characterizations -> XLS for collab
 * 222 and 223- UO determination by NAICS code?

Observable Outputs:

 * List of P and Tx facilities in CA should closely match permits
 * Disposition routes should be cleaned up & inspectable

Notes:

 - Complaints at stakeholder meeting mostly fell into correspondence
   between my definition of "processor" and DTSC's

   - apparently there are only 4 (or 6 or 8) permitted facilities for UO
     processing; I need to figure out which ones they are.  Other
     facilities are permitted for UO transfer; ditto.  Any facilities that
     show up on my list as receiving used oil manifests warrant further
     attention.

   - using the transfer station permitting, I should be able to improve my
     tx modeling.

Here is the layout:

The Grand Oil Model has essentially two phases: the Use phase, and the Mgmt
phase.  I have two parallel data sets which describe the Mgmt phase
(CalRecycle and DTSC); what I am doing now is reconciling them, which
basically means giving identity to the SRC_UNKNOWN and DEST_UNKNOWN flows
in the CalRecycle data set (assuming the DTSC data set is complete)

I am building a set of nodes (cr_node.m and md_node.m), which are
facilities which receive flows.  This matches the flows manuscript
perfectly.  In each dataset, I need to identify the flows which are
internal to the system (i.e. flows between nodes).  From md_node help: 

% Approach: classify each manifest record in group A, B, or C:
%
% A: straight GEN -> TSDF
% B: GEN -> Tx, nonterminal
% C: Tx -> TSDF, terminal

Characterizing the fragment input means looking at A and B flows; output
means looking at B and C flows.  

What the node function ultimately needs to deliver is identificatoin of the
B and C flows in the manifest.

But!  the data are not complete, because CR data is voluntary, and DTSC
data only tracks haz waste.  So, for instance, advanced environmental inc,
declassifies the oil and then ships it on to DK, but this doesn't show up
in either data set.

In truth, I don't know that Adv Env -> DK - I think it's something bob
boughton told me.  But who knows. Fontana.. could be a rail hookup.

according to corporationwiki.com, Bruce Demenno is President and Steve
Kerdoon is Manager.

So yeah.  probably shipping to DK, lol.

Need a reliable heuristic algorithm to determine what process to use for a
given facility's incoming waste.  Simple classification into groups for WC
221, 222, 223.

221 is easy- we have P, Tx, C, G; we've already determined H039 qtys for
each facility.  so: classify the facility as:

221:
 - DK
 - Ev
 - Decert : (x: DK; y: ex; 1-x-y: RFO-CA)
 - ex : ( a: RFO;  1-a: SK re-re)
 - SK

222: 


223:
 - dewatering 221
 - dewatering + RFO
 - Oil extraction 221 
 - Oil extraction + RFO
 - solid waste




List of EPAIDs and dispositions
ARD981057870 Clean Harbors - Incinerator - I-I

ugh how do I want to do this?????



All waste codes: follow method codes for H040, H050+H061, H132, H135
WC 221- assume 95% oil, 5% water
WC 222- assume 50% oil, 50% haz waste
WC 223- facility dependent?
ugh, time to go.
